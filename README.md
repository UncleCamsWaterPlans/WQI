# WQI
This package was devleoped as a way of sharing these data processing functions and tools within the team as first priority, 
but secondly to facilitate data extraction to stakeholders and collaborators. 
It includes data-out functions for the following resources:
- [Water Monitoring Information Portal](https://water-monitoring.information.qld.gov.au/), 
- [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- WQI's Eagle.IO instance. (*API keys may be granted upon request*)

There is no intention for a CRAN release, however it can be installed using this function:
```
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/UncleCamsWaterPlans/WQI")
```
